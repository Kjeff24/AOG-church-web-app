                            HISTORY OF ASSEMBLIES OF GOD, GHANA
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The Assemblies of God, Ghana is a member of the
                            worldwide fellowship of Assemblies of God spread in
                            212 countries of the world. Missionaries from
                            Assemblies of God, U.S.A. in the persons of Rev.
                            Lloyd and Margaret Shirer, who were then in
                            Moshiland, Ouagadougou now Burkina Faso crossed over
                            to the Northern Region of the then Gold Coast on
                            horse backs in the early 1931. With their first
                            recruits, Miss Beulah Buchhwalter and Guy Hickok,
                            they started the first Assemblies of God
                            congregation in Yendi.

                    Some others who joined later were Florennce Blossom, Henry
                    Garlock, Eric Johnson and Thelma Godwin. The zeal of these
                    early missionaries was so strong that they consistently
                    worked and witnessed for the Lord under very harsh
                    conditions and in hostile environments. The likes of
                    Bushwalker and Guy Hickock died in 1942 on the mission
                    field. Branches of the church were established at Tamale and
                    Walewale in 1935 and Bawku in 1937. Bro. Mba Mahama was the
                    first Mamprusi Christian to be converted in 1939. On
                    December 13, 1948, the Assemblies of God aeroplane,
                    &#8221;Ambassador&#8221; landed in Accra bringing the
                    Wheeler Andersons, Rody Johnson and Ozella Reid to join the
                    missionary family in the Gold Coast.

                    When the missionaries arrived, their preoccupation was to
                    preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They soon realised that
                    they were faced with the daunting and enormous task of
                    fighting hunger, disease, poverty and illiteracy. To give
                    practical meaning to the Biblical teaching of caring for the
                    needy and alleviating the suffering of the people, the
                    female missionaries organised literacy classes for the
                    indigenous women whiles the men organised work crews
                    teachings their male counterparts to make swish blocks, door
                    and window frames, and roof trusses. This improved the
                    economic lives of the people tremendously.
